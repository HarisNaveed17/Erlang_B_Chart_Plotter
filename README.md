# Erlang_B_Chart_Plotter
 A MATLAB script that generates Erlang B plots for a given number of channels.
 You can run the script multiple times to produce the entire Erlang B chart, although for now it can handle upto A = 100. Since MATLAB doesn't support dynamic legends and its workaround is confusing. I've used the semi - documented legend(~DynamicLegend) to update the legend while calling the function multiple times.
